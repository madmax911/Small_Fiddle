# Small_Fiddle
A small self-contained colorizing Javascript test environment
(and other useful utils)

Small_Fiddle.html is a very basic syntax highlighting
self-contained code editor.  It doesn't have all the
illustriousness of HighlightJS or any of the others but
it's small and it works in a pinch.  (on mobiles too)

The other file (G-code_hiliter.html) is a lightweight
g-code version of the same thing.

3NumberFinder - Just a simple script that will identify
missing numbers from a list given their sum.  Works for
1, 2 and 3 numbers added.  Can be useful for accounting
if you 'lost' a few numbers from a lust but have their
sum.
