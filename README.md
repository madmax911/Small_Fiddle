# Small_Fiddle
A small self-contained colorizing Javascript test environment
(and other useful utils)

Small_Fiddle.html is a very basic syntax highlighting
self-contained code editor.  It doesn't have all the
illustriousness of HighlightJS or any of the others but
it's small and it works in a pinch.  (on mobiles too)

Note:  This file has an embedded copy of the proggy
tiny free font in the html as a data uri.

The other file (G-code_hiliter.html) is a lightweight
g-code version of the same thing.

3NumberFinder.html - Just a simple script that will identify
missing numbers from a list given their sum.  Works for
1, 2 and 3 numbers added.  Can be useful for accounting
if you 'lost' a few numbers from a lust but have their
sum.

WebBarcode.html - Self-contained barcode label generator.
Note:  It uses a modified version of the free 3 of 9
barcode font.  I fixed the internal structure of this so
it could become embedable in an html data uri font.

HashSync.html - Store state object in URL hash (example).

Canvas_bounce_example.html & Smooth_infinite_scroll_example.html
 - Uses requestAnimationFrame to make cool things happen.

Screenly.html - Simple tool to compare app/page size to
common resolutions.
