# Small_Fiddle
A small self-contained colorizing Javascript test environment

Small_Fiddle.html is a very basic syntax highlighting
self-contained code editor.  It doesn't have all the
illustriousness of HighlightJS or any of the others but
it's small and it works in a pinch.  (on mobiles too)

The other file (G-code_hiliter.html) is a lightweight
g-code version of the same thing.
